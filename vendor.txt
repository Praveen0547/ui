Sync a fork of a repository to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository.

Before you can sync your fork with an upstream repository, you must configure a remote that points to the upstream repository in Git.

Open Git Bash.

Change the current working directory to your local project.

Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to master will be stored in a local branch, upstream/master.
